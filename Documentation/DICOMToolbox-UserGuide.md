└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Network Configuration Bar

The persistent bar at the top of the window holds PACS connection settings used by all network tools. Fields include:

| Field       | Description                              | Example          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Host        | PACS server hostname or IP address       | `192.168.1.100`  |
| Port        | PACS server port number                  | `11112`          |
| Called AE   | Application Entity title of the server   | `ORTHANC`        |
| Calling AE  | Your local Application Entity title      | `DICOMTOOLBOX`   |

A **Test Connection** button sends a C-ECHO to verify connectivity. A **Profile** dropdown lets you switch between saved server profiles.

### Tool Sidebar

Each tab displays a vertical list of tools on the left. Click a tool to load its parameter configuration panel. The sidebar shows the tool name and a brief description.

### Parameter Configuration Panel

The central area dynamically renders controls for the selected tool's parameters: file pickers, text fields, toggles, dropdowns, sliders, and date pickers. Parameters are mapped to their CLI equivalents and update the command preview in real time.

### Tab Bar

Six tabs group the 29 tools by category:

1. **File Inspection** — Examine DICOM file contents
2. **File Processing** — Transform and validate files
3. **File Organization** — Split, merge, and manage file collections
4. **Data Export** — Convert to JSON, XML, PDF, and image formats
5. **Network Operations** — PACS connectivity and data exchange
6. **Automation** — Study management, UID utilities, and scripting

### Console

The bottom panel displays the generated CLI command and its execution output. It uses a monospaced font (SF Mono) with syntax highlighting:

| Element     | Color  |
|-------------|--------|
| Tool name   | **Bold** |
| Flags       | Blue   |
| Values      | Green  |
| File paths  | Orange |

---

## Network Configuration

### Setting Up a PACS Connection

1. Enter the PACS server **Host**, **Port**, **Called AE Title**, and your **Calling AE Title** in the network configuration bar.
2. Click **Test Connection** to send a C-ECHO and verify the server responds.
3. A green checkmark indicates success; a red indicator shows the connection failed with an error message.

### Server Profiles

Save frequently used server configurations as profiles:

1. Configure the connection fields.
2. Click the **Profile** dropdown → **Save Current as Profile…**
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Radiology PACS", "Research Orthanc").

Switch between profiles using the dropdown. Profiles are stored locally and persist across sessions.

### Quick Presets

DICOMToolbox includes built-in presets for common configurations:

- **Local Orthanc** — `localhost:8042`, AE Title `ORTHANC`
- **Local DCM4CHEE** — `localhost:11112`, AE Title `DCM4CHEE`

Select a preset from **Profile → Presets** to populate the fields instantly.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem: "Connection failed" when testing PACS connectivity**

- Verify the PACS server is running and reachable on the network.
- Check that the Host, Port, and AE Titles are correct.
- Ensure your firewall allows outbound connections on the configured port.
- Confirm the PACS server has your Calling AE Title in its allowed list.

**Problem: Drag-and-drop does not recognize my file**

- Ensure the file has a `.dcm` extension or is a valid DICOM file.
- Try using the file picker instead if the file lacks a standard extension.
- Check that the file is not currently locked or open in another application.

**Problem: Command execution produces no output**

- Verify the input file path is correct and the file exists.
- Check the console for error messages (scroll down if output is long).
- Try running the equivalent command in Terminal to isolate the issue.

**Problem: Application is slow with large files**

- DICOM files with large pixel data (e.g., multi-frame CT) may take time to process.
- Close unused tabs to free memory.
- Use the CLI tools directly in Terminal for batch processing of very large datasets.

**Problem: Parameter panel shows unexpected options**

- Switch to Advanced Mode to see all available parameters.
- Reset the tool parameters using **Edit → Reset Parameters** or **⌘⇧R**.

### Getting Help

- **In-app help**: Press **⌘?** or select **Help → DICOMToolbox Help**.
- **DICOM Glossary**: **Help → DICOM Glossary** or **⌥⌘G**.
- **Report an issue**: **Help → Report Issue** opens the GitHub issue tracker.
- **Community**: Visit the DICOMKit GitHub Discussions page.
